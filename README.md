# fortran_qsort
Fortran implementation of qsort

I coded this as an exercise in preprocessor logic. But it should be working, so feel free to use it if you want to. But no guarantees, so don't blame me if things catch fire.

I don't care. qsort isn't new, but it's still fast. Use it in your code if you want to.
